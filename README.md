## Snake
A little fun project. Works in VS Code terminal (didn't make it compatible with other terminals and systems other than Windows).
## Try out
Download the `snake.py` file and open it with Python
```bash
python snake.py
```
## Controls
WASD - change direction
Press key twice to increase speed (resets when direction changes)
